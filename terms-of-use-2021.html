<p>Last Updated: July 2021</p>

<p>1. Scope</p>

<p>Concur Technologies, Inc. (SAP or SAP Concur) created and maintains the SAP Concur Developer Center websites, including all related websites, and other websites added to the SAP Concur Developer Center from time to time (collectively Developer Center) to provide a repository where customers and SAP Concur partners (You or Your) may obtain information about and access to programs and other materials made available by SAP. Such information about and access to programs and other materials might include, but are not limited to: articles, information, data, code, text, SAP Concur software or related documentation, documentation and product specification, application program interface specifications, concepts, designs, programming techniques and programming concepts, flow charts, graphics, images, training and other services as well as marketing material around SAP Concurs products and services (collectively Materials). The terms of this Terms of Use Agreement shall be referenced collectively as TOU herein.</p>

<p>2. Acceptance of Terms</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed to in a separate signed writing, Your access and use of the Developer Center, Materials, or any services provided on Developer Center (any Services), are subject to this TOU. This TOU forms a legally binding agreement between You and SAP regarding Your access and use of the Developer Center, Materials, and the Services. Whenever there is a conflict between the terms in this TOU and Your software license, partnership and/or maintenance agreement, the terms of your software license and /or maintenance agreement shall control Your access and use of Developer Center, Materials and Services.</p>

<p>By accessing or using Developer Center, You accept and agree to abide by the terms of this TOU. If You do not agree to the terms of this TOU, You must not attempt to access or use Developer Center.</p>

As used herein, Confidential Information shall mean all trade secrets and other information, Materials or Services which SAP or third parties protect against unrestricted disclosure to others which is either labeled Confidential, accessed through Developer Center, pursuant to software downloads, or reasonably identifiable as confidential based on the type of information and the manner of its disclosure. Reasonable steps means those steps You and/or Your company take to protect Your own similar Confidential Information, which shall not be less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall not be obligated to treat information as Confidential Information if such information (i) was rightfully in Your possession prior to receipt from or disclosure by SAP; or (ii) is or becomes public knowledge other than through Your fault; or (iii) is or was rightfully disclosed to You by a source other than SAP or any party under their respective control; or (iv) is independently developed by You without use of the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; or (v) must be disclosed by You according to mandatory applicable law. You are not permitted to access SAP or third party Confidential Information which You are not explicitly licensed to use as set forth in Your software license, partnership and/or maintenance agreement.</p>
