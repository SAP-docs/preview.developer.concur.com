# SCIM Groups

The following list contains roles and permissions for SAP Concur Expense, Request, Travel, Reporting products, that can be managed via SAP Concur [SCIM v4 Groups API](/api-reference/profile/v4.scim.html). 

The list is static and no new roles can be added or deleted via SAP Concur [SCIM v4 Groups API](/api-reference/profile/v4.scim.html). 

Other known restrictions and limitations: 
* When assigning Expense and Request product roles, user provisioning via SAP Concur [SCIM v4 Groups API](/api-reference/profile/v4.scim.html) is not sufficient. You need also to run second pass provisioning via flat files imports, [SAP Concur Provisioning v4 API](/api-reference/user-provisioning/v4.user-provisioning.html), or SAP SuccessFactor MDI replication, in order to enhance your users' identity data with employee/workforce person data.
* When assigning Travel and Reporting product roles, user must be active. Assigning Travel and Reporting roles to an inactive user is not supported at the moment.  
* Specifying SAP Concur user group context for group-aware roles is not supported at the moment. When using [SCIM v4 Groups API](/api-reference/profile/v4.scim.html) to manage SAP Concur users' roles assignments, 'Global' user group context is set by default.
