### <a name="status-changed-event"></a>Report Status Changed Event

The `statusChanged` event is intended to publish a message whenever the status of an expense report changes as it traverses the approval workflow during its life cycle. Subscribers of the event are able to leverage the data in the message to perform synchronous or asynchronous actions depending on their business processes. For example, this could trigger an application to make API calls to Concur Expense or start of a process in a third party application.

The `statusChanged` event will always be published for the following status changes without any additional configuration:

* Whenever a report is submitted.
* Whenever a report is sent back to the employee by an approver/processor.
* Whenever a report is recalled by the employee.
* Whenever a report stops in the legacy external validation step that is configured using the application connector.
* Whenever a report is paid.

In addition to the above, any workflow step configured for notifications by the administrator will also be published. Please refer to the **Procedure: Creating External Validations and Workflow Event Notifications** section of the [Workflow General - Setup Guide](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/_Current/SG_Exp/Exp_SG_Workflow_General.pdf) for more information on how the events can be configured  and optimized.

**Filtering of events by subscribers:**

* Subscribers only interested in the report submitted event should filter by `previousApprovalStatus` attribute in the payload and should specifically filter for values `A_NOTF` and `A_RESU`.
* Subscribers interested in the report sent back events should filter by the `stepCode` attribute in the payload with a value of `SENDBACK`.
* Subscribers interested in the report recalled events should filter by the `stepCode` attribute in the payload with a value of `RECALL`.
* Subscribers interested in the reports that are pending processing in the legacy external validation step events should filter by the `stepCode` attribute in the payload with a value of `EXTVAL`.
* Subscribers interested in the paid report events should filter by the `currentPaymentStatus` attribute in the payload with a value of `P_PAID`.
* Subscribers interested in all other events can filter by the `stepCode` attribute with the values entered by the administrator in the workflows Admin UI screens.
