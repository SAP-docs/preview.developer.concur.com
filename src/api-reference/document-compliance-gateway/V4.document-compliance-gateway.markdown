# Document Compliance Gateway v4

Document Compliance Gateway v4 API is designed to manage the transmission of the compliance document  to the validating vendor. Vendors can implement the API to read the compliance document sent to the SAP Concur system by the end user from an approved email, validate the compliance document against government records, and return the validation result. In addition, the vendor can read and parse the compliance document file to provide tax relevant data for creating expense entry.

The API supports an improved and efficient process for compliance document validation. The end user gets the compliance document validation result prior to expense creation preventing the unnecessary process, as well as, return and resubmission of the expense reports. The API also uses the data from the compliance document file to initiate the expense line item, saving the need for the user to manually type the information.

#### Notes

* The company JWT is data center specific. The auth service (/token endpoint) that signs the JWT determines which DC the JWT will work in. 
* To get a token or to refresh a token, use the curl command(s)specified [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html). It is recommended to have a valid token and scope to make the post call to the API.
* Once you have the token, use the following curl command to POST invoice details:
   
```sh
curl --location --request PUT 'https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{documentId}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>'
  -H "concur-correlationid": {LogicalId}\
  --form "digitalTaxDocument"=@"DigitalTaxToken.json"
```
