# Document Compliance Gateway v4

The Document Compliance Gateway v4 API is designed to manage the transmission of compliance documents between SAP Concur and validating vendors. Vendors can implement the API to exchange compliance documents with the SAP Concur system, validate those documents against relevant authoritative or regulatory sources, and return the validation results. Vendors can also read and parse the compliance document file to provide tax-related data for creating expense entries.

The API supports a streamlined and efficient process for compliance document validation. End users receive validation results prior to expense creation, helping to prevent unnecessary processing as well as the return and resubmission of expense reports. In addition, the API uses data extracted from the compliance document file to initiate the expense line item, reducing the need for manual data entry.

### Payload

* **[digitalTaxDocument](#DigitalTaxDocument-Schema)** - A digitalTaxDocument file in JSON format that is **required**.

*	**displayedVersion** - A multipart compliant document in human-readable PDF format.
     * If the end user only uploads the XML file, the partner will receive the event with _isDisplayVersionRequired_ _= true_.
       * In such scenarios, If the xml file is valid and processed, the partner needs to convert the XML file into PDF format and upload it in the **displayedVersion** field **mandatorily**.
       * If the XML file is invalid or has failed, uploading the displayedVersion is **optional** .

* **complianceDocument** - A multipart compliant e-document containing the structured e-invoice data.
  * The partner will receive the event with _isComplianceDocRequired_ _= true_.
    * In such scenarios, if the partner is able to fetch the compliance document from the official authorities ([status](#DigitalTaxDocument-Schema): _processed_), it must be provided in the **complianceDocument** field as a multipart attachment.
    * If the partner is not able to fetch the compliance document from the official authorities ([status](#DigitalTaxDocument-Schema): _failed_), uploading the complianceDocument is **optional**.

#### Notes

* The company JWT is data center specific. The auth service (/token endpoint) that signs the JWT determines which DC the JWT will work in.
* To get a token or to refresh a token, use the curl command(s)specified [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html). It is recommended to have a valid token and scope to make the post call to the API.
* Once you have the token, use the following curl command to post invoice details:

```sh
curl --location --request PUT 'https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{documentId}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>'
