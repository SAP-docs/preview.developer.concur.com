# Document Compliance Gateway v4 API

Document Compliance Gateway serves an important role as a router and abstraction layer between Concur core and DRC.

Enables Concur core to have a loose coupling with different compliance providers. Brings extensibility into the architecture which would enable integration of new compliance providers in Document Compliance Gateway layer without any changes in the core services. Makes the architecture homogenous for both pull and push model of receipt/invoice compliance. Any implementation specific to concur such as retrieval of the non-digitized documents from core and storage of the compliant documents in the core shall be done in Document Compliance Gateway and not in DRC. Can perform necessary mappings from a generic document model to Concur Invoice and Concur Expense specific data model for invoice/receipts

### Request

#### URI

##### Template

```shell
GET https://{region}.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{uuid}
```
##### Parameters

Name|Type|Format|Description
---|---|---|---

#### Notes

1. The company JWT is data center specific. The auth service (/token endpoint) that signs the JWT determines which DC the JWT will work in. It is recommended that the DRC should store the refresh token and use the geolocation response to make subsequent call to the DCG-API
2. To get a token or to refresh a token, use the curl command(s)specified [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html). It is recommended to have a valid token and scope to make the post call to DCG API.
3. Once you have the token use the following curl command to POST invoice details
```sh
curl --location --request GET 'https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{uuid}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>'
