# Detokenizer v5

The Detokenizer service allows clients to retrieve the user's credit card number from Concur Expense in a secure way. The Detokenizer service returns the user's credit card number encrypted with a symmetric key that the client provides in the request. The client will be able to decrypt the user's credit card number using their symmetric key. V5 version of detokenizer service is FIPS compliant so that customers with IBCP card programs, can benefit with credit card detokenizer functionality in CCPS environment. The Detokenizer API ensures secure transmission of sensitive data (card number) to customers as part of the remittance file creation process running at caller applications like ICS and CWS, in which the full, unmasked credit card number is required for the correct application of payments.

## <a name="authentication"></a>Authentication
 Authentication is done via company JWT with required scope creditcardaccount.read. The company JWT refers to the token belonging to the company whose data is being accessed. </br></br> If a company is accessing data on behalf of another company, then the calling company should invoke the detokenizer API using the JWT of the company that owns the card data. <br><br> Ex: If a company XYZ wants to call detokenizer api on behalf of another company ABC, then the company XYZ should access the api using ABC's company jwt.

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The detokenizer v5 API exposes the following resources and these have to be called sequentially: 

Resource|Description
---|---
RSAPublicKey|Retrieve RSA public Key via publickey API.
Credit Card Account Details|Retrieve credit card number via Detokenizer API.

## <a name="limitations"></a>Limitations

This API is only for public use to support various SAP integration features or to the SAP Concur customer that has established corporate credit card accounts involved in the data (the “Customer Corporate Card Holder”). Such use must be in compliance with regulations and other industry standards, including but not limited to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Access to this documentation does not provide access to the API.</br></br>
These APIs are available only in CCPS environment currently. Later, it will be available for other commercial environments also.
