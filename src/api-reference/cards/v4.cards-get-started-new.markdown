# Cards v4 - Getting Started

Cards v4 **write** APIs provide certified partner financial networks, issuing banks, and fin-tech partners with an automated path for mutual clients to make self-service connections between the partner and Concur Expense. This path enables the partner to subsequently submit Credit Card Account and Transaction data to Concur Expense in near real time. The write APIs are only available to **partners** who have been granted access and are creating a certified application. Those are not intended to be accessed by clients directly.

The Cards v4 **read** APIs can be used to read card transactions for a given user.
