# Cards v4 - Getting Started

Cards v4 API provides certified partner financial networks, issuing banks, and fin-tech partners with an automated path for mutual clients to make self-service connections between the partner and Concur Expense. This path enables the partner to subsequently submit Credit Card Account and Transaction data to Concur Expense in near real time. This API is only available to **partners** who have been granted access and are creating a certified application. It is not intended to be accessed by clients directly.
