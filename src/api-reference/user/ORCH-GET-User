  * Response: [Schema] or None

### Examples

#### Request

* Showing developers exactly what they can expect in request and response values when using is perhaps the simplest way to complete this portion of the documentation.
* Use triple backticks to create fenced code blocks and a language identifier for syntax highlighting.
* See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)

```shell
POST https://example.com/stores/123
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "orderId": "value",
  "orderMemo": "value"
}
```

#### Response

* Ensure the headers are kept separate as a code block from the payload for ease of reading.
* Add the language identifier to any code blocks for syntax highlighting
* See the GitHub topic [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for more information.

### <a name="schema-one"></a>Schema One

Name|Type|Format|Description

`transactionTimestamp`|`string`|[dateTime](#definition-dateTime)|A key linking to a definition for the format.

### <a name="schema-error"></a>Error

Name|Type|Format|Description
---|---|---|---
`errorCode`|`string`|-|**Required** Machine readable code associated with the error which is static and never localized. Examples: `dateTimeMissing`, `OutOfMem` and `invalidUser`. These could also be UUID4 (`a1d7bb3bb19348b0858687acc9e303ec`), number (`123456`) or a URI (`https://example.com/errors/invaliduser`) which ideally provides additional information when dereferenced. Whatever form is chosen it's worth noting contextual strings are helpful to developers reading the code.
`errorMessage`|`string`|-|**Required** Message associated with the error.
`dataPath`|`string`|-|Relative data path.
`schemaPath`|`string`|-|Relative schema path.
`errors`|`array`|[`error`](#schema-error)|An array of errors. Note: this points to this schema as errors can nest.
