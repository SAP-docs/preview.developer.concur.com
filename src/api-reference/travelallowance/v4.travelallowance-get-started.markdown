# Travel Allowance v4 - Getting Started

The Travel Allowance Service provides an automated solution for managing employee travel expenses. It streamlines
the process of creating, approving, and reimbursing travel allowances, ensuring compliance with company policies. This
service helps organizations save time and reduce administrative burdens by simplifying travel expense management.

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The Travel Allowance v4 API does only provide data of the new Travel Allowance Service and does not support legacy Travel Allowance data.
This API exposes three different resources:

---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Itinerary           | You can read and write Travel Allowance Itinerary data.                                  
 Calculation Results | You can read Calculation Results for Itineraries assigned to a specific context.  
 Configuration       | You can read Travel Allowance Configuration.
