>**NOTE**: The User API can be used to add new users, however the user accounts will not be fully configured and ready for use. Additional work to the user profiles must be completed, either with manual edits or updates via the user import, in order to complete the user profiles. There is a high degree of variability in customer configuration that is not all supported by this API. Manual edits or updates via a file import are most likely required to complete the User profiles started with this API. Only POST is supported. Please use the [Employee Import](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/_Current/SPC/Spc_Shr/Shr_SPEC_Emp_Imp.pdf) feature if the User API does not meet your needs.

    POST api/user/v1.0/users
