<p>SAP Concur has updated the Request v4 API documentation to match the SAP Concur API documentation standard. As this documentation has been in active EA for several months, we are providing this document change notification for all EA clients and SAP Concur internal staff.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These changes will be published <em>at least</em> one week after this notification is posted, so the new URLs will not be active until then. The  notification period is meant to allow all users of the API to update their links. SAP Concur does not guarantee that the new content will be available exactly one week from this posting, as publishing times vary.</p>
