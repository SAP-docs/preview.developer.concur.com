<p>The Payment Provider App Category streamlines the Invoice Payment process for SAP-Concur customers. The Payment Provider Partner‚Äôs certified app will obtain Invoice data from our customers‚Äô Concur site by using the ‚ÄúQuick Connect‚Äù process and executing their app using Concur‚Äôs Invoice APIs. To be certified, the Partner must support both Editions of SAP-Concur Invoice: Standard Edition and Professional Edition.</p>

<p>In order to pay a customer‚Äôs invoices, the SAP-Concur Invoice Vendor record must have the value of <strong>PAYPVD</strong> populated within the ‚ÄúPayment Method Type‚Äù field.  This can be populated in 3 ways, one of which is via API.  The Partner and customer need to agree who will be responsible for updating the Vendors initially and on an on-going basis. Here are the methods the Vendor (aka Supplier) record can be updated:</p>

<p>If the customer wants invoices paid early in order to take advantage of the Vendor‚Äôs discount terms, the customer and partner will need to work together. The customer will need to configure search queries within the administrative tool called, ‚ÄúInvoice Processor‚Äù. The search parameters will based on invoice due date and Payment Method Type field.  The search query parameters need to include enough days to allow the customer and partner to meet the invoice terms. Once the customer administrator final-approves those invoices, the Partner will be able to obtain the invoices that are pending payment. In order to obtain the discount terms, the Partner will have to use the GET Payment Request API using the invoice ID from the GET Payments response.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the customer and partner need to discuss how the customer manages the discounts within the SAP-Concur Invoice product. The customer may elect to adjust the invoice amount field and then add credited line items within the invoice to reflect the discount.  In this case, the partner will <strong>not</strong> need to compute the discount and will just use the value in the Invoice Amount field.</p>
