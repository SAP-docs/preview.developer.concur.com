<p>The Purchase Request API gives SAP Concur clients the ability to leverage external data to create purchase requests for pre-authorization of purchase orders. Clients can build a direct connection to the Purchase Request API which will create new purchase requests and automatically submit them into the pre-authorization workflow. Once approved, the purchase request results in a purchase order that can be transmitted to a vendor from SAP Concur.</p>
