<p>2018-10-08 :: <strong>Trip Approval v1 API Is Retired</strong></p>

<p>Concur has retired the Trip Approval API. This API provided 3rd parties with the ability to manage Concur Travel trip approvals (as required by Concur Travel rules and policy) in systems outside of Concur Travel. This API is inactive and is no longer supported. All trip approval functions within Concur Travel and Concur Request will continue to function as usual.  Only the external API endpoint is being retired. More details can be found in the <a href="/api-reference/travel/trip-approval/v1.trip-approval-resource.html">Trip Approval v1</a> documentation.</p>
