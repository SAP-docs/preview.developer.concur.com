<h2 id="listing-requirements">Listing Requirements</h2>

<p>As part of our commitment to provide our clients with information on upcoming apps their employees will see in the App Center, we have unique requirements for this app type. These requirements provide our clients with the opportunity to learn more about upcoming apps. While not common, client administrators can also take the opportunity to disable connections by their employees to specific apps if needed.</p>

<p>All new user connection app listings must meet the two following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Must schedule inclusion in our App Center release notes for a minimum two-week period prior to going live in the App Center. Scheduled via Marketing Contact.</li>
  <li>Must schedule live date in conjunction with our monthly SAP Concur releases. Scheduled via Marketing Contact.</li>
</ol>

<p>The content for release notes will be derived from the App Center Partner Listing Form. Your app will be included in our release notes first as an app ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù for the minimum two week period; your app will then be updated in our release notes to ‚ÄúNow Available‚Äù on the applicable release date.</p>

<p>This table includes deadlines for submitting your Application Certification and App Center Listing forms to meet your desired App Center launch in conjunction with our monthly SAP Concur releases.</p>

<p>Please send any questions to Concur_AppCenterMarketing@sap.com.</p>
