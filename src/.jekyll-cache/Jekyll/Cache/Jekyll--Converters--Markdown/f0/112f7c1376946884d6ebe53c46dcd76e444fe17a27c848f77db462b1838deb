<h2 id="workflow-actions"><a name="workflow-actions"></a>Workflow Actions</h2>

<p>The available actions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Approve</strong>: The report successfully completes the current workflow step. The report will continue in the workflow, and may require additional approvals based on configuration. If the report was in the Processing Payment status, it will be moved to the Paid status.<br />
<strong>NOTES</strong>:
    <ol>
      <li>Reports canâ€™t be moved from Processing Payment to Paid until all of their expense entries have been extracted or manually paid. Wait until the extract process completes for the report, then send the Approve workflow action.</li>
      <li>This API is not supported for the Processor role or expense reports pending the Processor workflow step.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Send Back to Employee</strong>: The report is sent back to the employee for revision. When the user resubmits the report, it travels through the entire workflow again.</li>
  <li><strong>Recall to Employee</strong>: This workflow action is initiated by the employee, and is only available after the report has been submitted. This workflow action may not be available to some clients due to configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Prior to calling this endpoint the Caller <em>must</em> check the Approval Status found in the <strong>ApprovalStatusName</strong> element in the response for <a href="/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v3.reports.html#getID">Get Report Details</a> to ensure the report is at the workflow step the Caller expects.Â  Under no circumstance should a Caller make a call to this endpoint without being certain the report is at the workflow step the Caller expects.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-roles"><a name="workflow-roles"></a>Workflow Roles</h2>
<p>Each workflow step in a workflow is associated with a workflow role. Professional clients can configure workflow steps and roles in the Workflows area of Expense Admin. The OAuth consumer is evaluated to determine which role(s) the consumer has in SAP Concur. There are two different types of workflow roles as described in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id="system-role"><a name="system-role"></a>System Role</h3>
<p>The System role is used when the workflow actions can be completed programatically. Any workflow action can be completed this way, depending on the clientâ€™s business process. The workflow role can be configured while adding the report workflow step. Some steps may require the System role. When using this role, the OAuth consumer must have the following user role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard/Developer Sandbox: Can Administer</li>
  <li>Professional: Company Admin or Web Services Administrator</li>
</ul>

<p>The expense report owner must have an approver or processor assigned to them before the System role can make changes to their reports.</p>

<h3 id="approver-role"><a name="approver-role"></a>Approver Role</h3>

<p>The Approver role is used when the workflow action should be completed by a particular user. Developers who want to present a list of reports to approve and send the workflow action when the reports have been evaluated by the approver use the Approver role. This role requires that a user with the correct SAP Concur role (Expense Approver, Authorized Approver, Cost Object Approver, or Expense Processor for Professional, or the Can Administer or Can Approve Reports roles for Standard) authenticates using Standard OAuth before supplying the workflow action. The user must also have access (be a valid approver or processor) for the supplied report ID.</p>
