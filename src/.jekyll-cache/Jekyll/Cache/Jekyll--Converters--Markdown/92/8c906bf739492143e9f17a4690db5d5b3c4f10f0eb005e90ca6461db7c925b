<p>This update removed two outdated APIs.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-retirement-and-decommission-of-existing-concur-request-apis-v10-v30-v31"><a name="ongoing-request-retirement"></a>Ongoing: Retirement and Decommission of Existing Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1)</h2>

<p>Effective December 1, 2020, SAP Concur will be retiring the existing Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, and v3.1). These APIs are replaced by the Concur Request v4 APIs.</p>

<h3 id="business-purpose--client-benefit-1">Business Purpose / Client Benefit</h3>

<p>The Concur Request APIs v1.0, v3.0 and v3.1 only support the previous authentication method, which is not best security practice and does not meet the Oauth2 standards. In addition, the previous versions of the Concur Request APIs provided limited possibilities for moving a Request through the approval workflow, as well as managing custom simple &amp; connected list fields. These issues are resolved with the new Concur Request v4 APIs.</p>

<p>In addition, SAP Concur has run a backward compatibility project between the current Concur Request APIs and the new Concur Request v4 APIs (not iso-compatibility) in order to have the vast majority of use cases managed in the previous versions also be managed in the Concur Request v4 APIs.</p>

<h2 id="budget-v4-api-soon-available"><a name="budget-v4"></a>Budget v4 API Soon Available</h2>

<p>SAP Concur has released the Budget v4 API. Budget v4 provides the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fiscal Calendar:</strong> This API can GET, POST, and DELETE fiscal years and periods similar to the Fiscal Calendar UI in Budget Configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Category:</strong> This API can GET, POST, and DELETE budget categories, and GET all expense types of a budget category.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Items:</strong> This API can GET, POST, and DELETE budget items including details such as period amounts, budget item tracking fields (cost objects), budget viewers, managers, and approvers.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Tracking Field:</strong> This API can GET all budget tracking fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Adjustment:</strong> This API can POST budget adjustments.</li>
  <li><strong>Global Availability:</strong> Budget v4 API is supported in all SAP Concur data centers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="business-purpose--client-benefit-2">Business Purpose / Client Benefit</h3>

<p>This new Budget API enables users to integrate Budget with their
ERP and HR systems to automate budget configuration and maintenance as well as
importing external transactions not captured via SAP Concur through budget
adjustments.</p>
