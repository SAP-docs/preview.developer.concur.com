<p>This guide will provide the steps to enable an enterprise application, which does require administrative permissions. It will provide information on the permission required, adding the permissions for existing users, and enabling the application.</p>

<p>Depending on the application, there are two methods of enabling the integration:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#connect-app">Connect from the App Center</a>. Note: Apps eligible for this type of connection utilize <a href="/api-reference/authentication/company-auth.html">OAuth 2.0 Company-Level Authorization</a> and will have a Connect button displayed within the app listing.</li>
</ul>
