<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The Concur List Item web service provides an automated solution to clients who would like to add, update or delete list items. This web service solves several business problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Files are difficult to manage: The service allows clients to send the data programatically, without requiring files to be moved and managed.</li>
  <li>Need to work outside the Overnight Processing Period (ONP): Clients that need to make updates outside the ONP can use the List Item web service to modify their list items at any time. This allows users to quickly submit expense reports using the new values.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="works-with-these-concur-products">Works With These Concur Products</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Expense</strong> for Concur Professional/Premium</li>
  <li><strong>Expense</strong> for Concur Standard</li>
  <li><strong>Invoice</strong> for Concur Professional/Premium</li>
  <li><strong>Invoice</strong> for Concur Standard</li>
  <li><strong>Travel Request</strong> for Concur Professional/Premium</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="product-restrictions">Product Restrictions</h2>

<p>Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.</p>

<p>Partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process.</p>

<p>Existing clients can work with Concur Advantage Technical Services to create customÂ applications that work with their configuration.</p>

<h3 id="list-item-errors">List item errors</h3>

<p>The web service will not return a 4xx HTTP response code for a batch operation even when every item in the batch failed to be created, updated or deleted. The client must inspect the response to look for warnings or errors with individual batch items.</p>

<p>When there are errors with batch items, the first ten errors are returned in the <errors> element in the request response, which includes their error code, the item that caused the error, and the error message. Any additional error messages are truncated. This prevents a large volume of error data in the event of a formatting mistake.</errors></p>

<h2 id="changing-a-list-item-level-code"><a name="changing-level-code"></a>Changing a List Item Level Code</h2>

<p>The list item level code (levelxcode element) is the unique identifier for the list item. For multiple level lists, the combination of the level codes is the unique identifier. This value cannot be updated by a standard update request, as this will result in a new duplicate list value instead.<br />
To change a list itemâ€™s level code, the original list item must be deleted (using the Post List Item Deletion request), then the new item with the updated code must be added (using the Post New List Item request).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When you delete a list item, the system deactivates it, but keeps a copy in case the item has been used in any expense reports, invoices or requests. Existing reports, invoices or requests will still show the old list item. Any reports, invoices or requests created after the list item has been deleted will no longer show it in the list.</p>
