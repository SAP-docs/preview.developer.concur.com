I"ä<p>The Ground Transportation Direct Connect provides a method for Travel users to access the inventory of ground transportation service providers. This direct connect was originally designed for use by limo service providers, but can be used with all forms of ground transportation.</p>

<p>Once the ground transportation supplier has developed their interface with SAP Concur, their inventory will begin appearing in ground transportation searches by opted-in Travel users.</p>

<p>This callout differs from the inbound SAP Concur web services in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It uses an <strong>outbound</strong> <strong>message</strong> where Travel calls a public facing API endpoint provided by the ground transportation supplier.</li>
  <li>The supplier configures and maintains the public web service interface. This guide specifies the request and response format required by SAP Concur.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This direct connect was originally designed to work with Limo providers, but can support all types of ground transportation.</p>

<p>This direct connect is only available to Travel Suppliers with Ground Transportation inventory. This direct connect is not supported in the SAP Concur mobile application.</p>

<p>SAP Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.</p>

<p>Partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-process"><a name="config-process"></a>Configuration Process</h2>

<p>The configuration process has the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Travel Supplier creates the application on their system that will accept the requests from SAP Concur and return the appropriate responses.</li>
  <li>The Travel Supplier creates the endpoint on their system that SAP Concur uses to access their inventory.</li>
  <li>SAP Concur creates a production company for the travel supplier.</li>
  <li>The Travel Supplier registers their application with SAP Concur by logging in to their production company.</li>
  <li>SAP Concur configures Travel to send requests to the endpoint.</li>
  <li>The Travel client opts in to the Ground Transportation callout using the Travel Configuration UI to allow their users to view and book the available inventory. Clients must contact SAP Concur to have this setting activated</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the configuration is complete, the callout uses the following process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user searches for ground transportation when creating an itinerary in Travel.</li>
  <li>Travel sends the search details to the endpoint, using the Post Search Request.</li>
  <li>The supplier returns the search results.</li>
  <li>If the user chooses to reserve the ride, Travel sends the Post Sell Request.</li>
  <li>The supplier returns the Post Sell Reply.</li>
</ol>

<p>This callout can also be used to perform the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the Reservation Details</li>
  <li>Cancel the Ground Transportation Reservation</li>
  <li>Update the Ground Transportation Reservation with the Supplier</li>
  <li>Update the Ground Transportation Reservation with Travel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="authentication"><a name="authentication"></a>Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication between SAP Concur and the application connector is performed using OAuth.</p>
