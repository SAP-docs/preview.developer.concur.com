<p>The Concur API Lifecycle &amp; Deprecation Policy is part of our <a href="/Terms-of-Use.html">API terms and conditions of use.</a> We may make periodic updates to this Policy, at which time we will notify those who have agreements with us.</p>

<h2 id="api-version-status">API Version Status</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Active:</strong> An active API version is the most current and fully supported API. It is the recommended version to use by everyone.</li>
  <li><strong>Deprecated:</strong> A deprecated API version has been superseded by a newer API version. It is supported (bug fixes) for six months from the deprecation date. New apps will be denied access to deprecated APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Retired:</strong> A retired API version is no longer supported. It includes any API deprecated for more than six months. Any application using a retired API must migrate to an active API.</li>
  <li><strong>Decommissioned:</strong> A decommissioned API version is no longer available on production. This occurs after three (3) months of inactivity in Retired state.</li>
</ul>
