<h2 id="overview"><a name="itinerary-overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The Itinerary API can be used to programmatically access travel data such as trips and bookings in Concur Travel. Concur Travel uses this data to match and consolidate bookings it receives from disparate sources and put these into consolidated travelersâ€™ itineraries, providing travelers a convenient way to view their trips in a single itinerary view. Travelers can view their itineraries through mobile applications or other services.</p>

<h3 id="itineraries-and-trips">Itineraries and Trips</h3>

<p>The terms itinerary and trip are synonyms. Trip is the name used for the SAP Concur web service resource that represents an itinerary.</p>

<h3 id="itinerary-booking-record-and-segment">Itinerary, Booking Record, and Segment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An <em>itinerary</em> is the container for all bookings in a trip. An itinerary can have more than one booking.</li>
  <li>A <em>booking record</em> is the container for all segments booked from a source with the same unique identifier (<em>record locator</em> or <em>confirmation number</em>). A single booking can have multiple segments.</li>
  <li>A <em>segment</em> includes details about the travel booking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-can-use-this-web-service"><a name="itin-use"></a>Who Can Use This Web Service?</h2>

<p>TripLink suppliers, travel management companies (TMCs), and SAP Concur clients and third-party developers can use the Itinerary API. The level of access to the data in the Concur Travel system depends on who is accessing it and the SAP Concur products that have been purchased.</p>

<h3 id="travel-management-companies">Travel Management Companies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Can view and post bookings for any travel type.</li>
  <li>Send new reservations that users create on the supplierâ€™s site to SAP Concur.</li>
  <li>Send a notice of trip cancellations to SAP Concur.</li>
  <li>Get a list of current trips for a user from SAP Concur.</li>
  <li>Get the full details of user trips from SAP Concur.</li>
  <li>Can view the full set of fields for their customersâ€™ itineraries because TMCs have an existing relationship with their customers.</li>
  <li>Can send proposed itineraries when the Agency Proposal feature of Concur Request is active.</li>
  <li>Can cancel bookings on behalf of a user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="triplink-travel-suppliers">TripLink Travel Suppliers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Can post bookings for their travel type.</li>
  <li>Get limited itinerary details.</li>
  <li>Get the full details of the bookings that they own, but see a limited set of fields and data for other bookings.</li>
  <li>Modify bookings.</li>
  <li>Cancel bookings for their travel type.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sap-concur-clients-and-third-party-developers">SAP Concur Clients and Third-Party Developers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Get trip information for SAP Concur users. SAP Concur clients who purchase Web Services have access to their own trip data, while third party developers have access to the SAP Concur trip data of the clients who authorize them.</li>
  <li>Third-party partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to start using this web service, please visit: <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/connect-platform/suppliers">http://www.concur.com/en-us/connect-platform/suppliers</a> or contact the SAP Partner Enablement Team. SAP Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.</p>

<p>Some itinerary data may have come from Sabre. SAP Concur encourages you to speak to Sabre about becoming a Sabre Authorized Developer.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization"><a name="itin-auth"></a>Authentication and Authorization</h2>

<p>The Itinerary API uses OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users and authorizing access to travel data.</p>

<h3 id="authorization-for-tmcs">Authorization for TMCs</h3>

<p>TMCs can request or send travel bookings in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By using an OAuth token for the user the travel booking belongs to. This token allows access to the userâ€™s data.</li>
  <li>By using an OAuth token for a user with an administrative role at the company, which allows access to company-wide information. The user who authenticates during this OAuth process must have an SAP Concur account with one of the following user roles: <strong>Web Services Administrator</strong> for Professional, or <strong>Can Administer</strong> for Standard.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="authorization-for-triplink-suppliers">Authorization for TripLink Suppliers</h3>

<p>The travel supplier can request or send travel bookings by using an OAuth token for the user the travel booking belongs to, generated with the userâ€™s involvement.</p>

<h2 id="configuration"><a name="itin-config"></a>Configuration</h2>

<h2 id="faqs"><a name="itin-faq"></a>FAQs</h2>

<h4 id="when-do-i-send-trips-versus-bookings">When Do I Send Trips Versus Bookings?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>TMCs, OTA, or partners that own or manage the entire trip on behalf of the traveler should send trips.</li>
  <li>Travel suppliers such as hotels, car vendors or airlines that own only parts of the trips should send bookings.</li>
  <li>Posted bookings are merged with any existing trips if their dates overlap.</li>
  <li>Posted trips are not merged even if a trip already exists with overlapping dates.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="can-other-triplink-suppliers-see-all-the-booking-details-of-my-bookings">Can Other TripLink Suppliers See all the Booking Details of My Bookings?</h4>

<p>The Itinerary API returns the full booking details to the supplier who will provide the booked service. Suppliers that are not the service provider will receive a subset of the possible fields. These vary by the type of booking relative to the type of supplier. For example, Air booking suppliers that are not the supplier will not see the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vendor</li>
  <li>FlightNumber</li>
  <li>StartDateLocal</li>
  <li>StartDateUtc</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-can-we-save-additional-charges-for-hotel-and-car-segments-what-types-of-charges-are-supported">How Can We Save Additional Charges for Hotel and Car Segments? What Types of Charges Are Supported?</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Charges</code> element under Car and Hotel segments allow you to save additional charges using Semantics Codes. Refer to the Semantics and Vendor Codes sections under <a href="#reference-topics">Reference</a> for more information.</p>

<h4 id="what-vendor-codes-can-i-use-when-sending-hotel-and-car-segments">What Vendor Codes Can I Use When Sending Hotel and Car Segments?</h4>

<p>Refer to the Semantics and Vendor Codes sections for the full list.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-view-a-trip-posted-through-the-itinerary-api-in-the-sap-concur-ui">Can I View a Trip Posted Through the Itinerary API in the SAP Concur UI?</h4>

<p>Yes. The user who owns the trip will see the trip on their home page. If the trip is in the future, it will show under the upcoming trip list. Trips that are ready to expense will show in the expense report list.</p>

<h4 id="when-can-a-trip-be-expensed">When Can a Trip Be Expensed?</h4>

<p>Trips can be expensed after the trip is over under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The trip has a Car, Hotel, or Ride segment.</li>
  <li>The trip has an Air segment with a ticket and the ticket has at least one valid ticket coupon, meaning the coupon is in one of the following statuses:</li>
  <li>OPEN</li>
  <li>USED</li>
  <li>PRTD</li>
  <li>StartDateUtc</li>
</ul>

<p>Air segments can be expensed as soon as they have a ticket with a valid coupon, if the company uses the PreExpenseAir option.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-my-new-booking-not-showing-in-the-ui">Why is My New Booking Not Showing in the UI?</h4>

<p>The request returned successfully with HTTP status - 200 OK. Posted bookings are automatically merged with any existing trip with overlapping dates. Most likely, a trip exists with the same dates and the booking has been added to it.</p>

<h4 id="will-posted-bookings-be-overwritten-by-emailed-or-tripit-trips">Will Posted Bookings Be Overwritten by Emailed or TripIt Trips?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4 id="will-posted-bookings-merge-with-existing-cliqbook-or-tripit-trips">Will Posted Bookings Merge with Existing Cliqbook or TripIt Trips?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h4 id="will-posted-trips-merge-with-existing-trips">Will Posted Trips Merge with Existing Trips?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices"><a name="itin-best-practices"></a>Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When extracting past data:
    <ul>
      <li>Extract a month of trip summaries to gauge volume. If hundreds are returned, then adjust extraction to weekly.</li>
      <li>Do not extract more than a year of data at any given time regardless of the volume. For longer look backs, extract six month segments maximum at a time.</li>
      <li>Do not multi-thread requests to retrieve multiple pages of data. Concurrent requests will impact your applicationâ€™s performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This API will only return itineraries that have been sent to Concur Travel; this includes travel booked within Concur Travel, TripIt, on TripLink supplier sites, plans emailed to Concur, and most bookings from your travel agency.
    <ul>
      <li>Some customers may have multiple booking options, which may mean not all employee trips are available via this API. A good rule of thumb: if the traveler sees the itinerary in their â€œtripsâ€ list, then you can retrieve it from this API.</li>
      <li>Because the data comes from many sources, data across itineraries may not be consistent. Itâ€™s recommended that you only consume the relevant segments and data (for example, air only or air + hotel) for your applicationâ€™s function.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Itineraries change frequently. Changes do not necessarily indicate that the traveler modified their trip. You should address relevant changes only. This may mean comparing what your application considers relevant (for example, trip dates) across updated itineraries. In addition:
    <ul>
      <li>If your application works with upcoming or in progress trips, be aware that you must evaluate the individual segments to determine whether it is a material change for your application.</li>
      <li>If your app is consuming itineraries before the trip occurs, cancellations should be taken into account. To incorporate cancelled trips, set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeCancelledtrips</code> flag to â€œtrueâ€ and leverage the trip status field to determine the application action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your app should log key identifiers in addition to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tripID</code>. It is recommended that â€œclient locatorâ€ and user UUID be tracked so you can troubleshoot issues and match to data that customers have available.</li>
  <li>Many customers will opt-in to your integration for only a subset of their regions. It is recommended that you provide options, leveraging the userâ€™s country in the travel profile, to determine which itineraries to extract.</li>
  <li>There are three different booking modes, all of which should be considered when building your application. Note that some clients additionally allow individuals to book for multiple passengers at a time.
    <ul>
      <li>An individual booking for themselves.</li>
      <li>An individual booking on behalf of another user (profiled user).</li>
      <li>An individual booking for a guest (non-profiled user).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SAP Concur converts local date/time to UTC.  In order to do that we need to be able to determine where the local time is.</p>

<h4 id="olson-time-zones">Olson Time Zones</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Best practice is providing <strong>TimeZone</strong> (Olson or Windows time zone format) in addition to the required <strong>StartDateLocal</strong> and <strong>EndDateLocal</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you cannot provide <strong>TimeZone</strong> (Olson or Windows time zone format), SAP Concur recommends <strong>StartDateUtc</strong> and <strong>EndDateUtc</strong> in addition to the required <strong>StartDateLocal</strong> and <strong>EndDateLocal</strong>.</li>
  <li>Least preferable is providing <strong>StartCityCode</strong> in addition to the required <strong>StartDateLocal</strong> and <strong>EndDateLocal</strong>, if you cannot provide <strong>TimeZone</strong> or <strong>StartDateUtc</strong> and <strong>EndDateUtc</strong>.</li>
