<h3 id="foreign-expense-report-without-vat"><a name="uferwv"></a>Foreign Expense Report Without VAT</h3>

<h4 id="description-8">Description</h4>

<p>The SAP Concur system, when configured and applicable, will calculate the related VAT tax for a given transaction. In some cases, this tax is deductible if it meets certain country-based requirements. In other cases, it is not deductible. This determination relies on the customer‚Äôs tax configuration and will vary by customer and country. The posting document will include all related VAT amounts that are calculated.</p>

<p>In case an employee from a country with VAT enters a foreign receipt and the included VAT is not claimable, the document has to be posted with a 0% VAT tax code. In SAP Concur this tax code is normally customized for the tax authority in the non-domestic code field. Again, this will vary based on the exact use case and customer‚Äôs tax configuration.</p>

<h4 id="posting-example-8">Posting Example</h4>

<p>A UK employee submits an entry for a US-based training. In this case the posting document will include U.S tax included on the receipt and the posting will be handled in the ERP according to the desired posting record. It‚Äôs common that the posting record will include the tax amount as part of the overall expense (in this case Hotel) but a valid tax code with a 0% rate will also be included. This allows the customer to report on foreign taxes paid but which are not reclaimable.</p>

<p>The posting below is one example of how the expense gets recorded by the customer based on their ERP set up and requirements.</p>

<h2 id="cost-allocation"><a name="ucosta"></a>Cost Allocation</h2>

<p>What is cost allocation? Allocation is defined as a part of cross-charging is the ability to assign cost of an expense to multiple organizational units such as department, cost center, project code, etc.</p>

<p>When allocating the expense across multiple cost centers, the user needs to pick the correct code from the most granular level which may be from the Expense Entry, Journal Entry, and/or Allocation Entry depending on whether or not the customer is configured to use the allocation fields. Cost center codes should NEVER be picked up from the Employee Entry section because an employee may have to charge another department for a percentage of a transaction.</p>

<h3 id="expense-with-multiple-cost-allocations"><a name="uewmca"></a>Expense With Multiple Cost Allocations</h3>

<h4 id="description-10">Description</h4>

<p>Similar to the itemized expense example, however, the breakfast cost is allocated between two different cost centers.</p>

<p>The employee enters an expense report and assigns a cash advance. This cash advance reduces the employee‚Äôs payout amount. Only the difference between the sum of the expense items paid by the employee and the cash advance will be paid to the employee.</p>

<p>The user has requested and received an GBP 300 cash advance. In the course of travel the user incurs the following cash expenses: GBP 245 for a rental car, GBP 60 for a business meal, and GBP 10 for parking. After returning from travel the user finds the GBP 300 cash advance has been issued via the corporate card import process. He assigns the GBP 300 cash advance to an expense report and enters the three cash expenses and submits. The expenses are not itemized. The expenses are legitimate business expenses.</p>

<h3 id="cash-advance-is-higher-than-the-payout-amount"><a name="ucahtp"></a>Cash Advance Is Higher Than the Payout Amount</h3>

<h4 id="description-13">Description</h4>

<p>The employee enters an expense report and assigns a cash advance. If the cash advance is higher than the sum of the expense items paid by the employee the employee owes the difference to the company.</p>

<h4 id="posting-example-13">Posting Example</h4>

<p>The user has requested and received a GBP 400 cash advance and during travel spends GBP245 on a rental car, GBP 60  on a business meal, and GBP 10 on parking. The user assigns the GBP 400 cash advance to the expense report and enters the three cash expenses and submits. The expenses are not itemized. The expenses are legitimate business expenses. Because the total of the cash advance exceeds the sum of the business expenses the net result of the expense report is that the employee owes the company the balance. The employee will write a check to the company for the balance (GBP 85) and enter a cash advance return transaction in that amount to net the expense report to zero.</p>

<p>The employee mistakenly uses the corporate card to pay for a personal dinner expense of USD 300. When the corporate card transaction feed populates the company card page the employee must deal with this transaction. The employee assigns the USD 300 corporate card transaction to an expense report, marks it as a non-reimbursable expense and submits the report for approval.</p>
