<h3 id="2019-10-03--support-for-tls-v11-encryption-protocol-to-end-in-first-quarter-of-2020">2019-10-03 :: Support for TLS v1.1 Encryption Protocol to End in First Quarter of 2020</h3>

<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>SAP Concur is announcing an end-of-support cycle for version 1.1 of the Transport
Layer Security (TLS) encryption protocol, while continuing support for the more
secure version 1.2 of TLS. As background, the TLS protocol allows secure back and
forth communications between a phone or computer and a cloud-based service.</p>

<p>This change is currently planned for the first quarter of 2020.</p>

<h5 id="business-purpose--client-benefit">BUSINESS PURPOSE / CLIENT BENEFIT</h5>

<p>SAP Concur is taking this step after careful consideration of our customersâ€™ security and ease of upgrade to the newer, more secure version 1.2 of TLS. This end-of support plan for TLS v1.1 ensures our clients are communicating with SAP Concur
solutions in a safer and more secure manner using TLS v1.2.</p>

<h4 id="what-the-customer-sees">What the Customer Sees</h4>

<p>If the customer or user ensures they are using a TLS v1.2-compliant browser, there
will be no change in the way users interact with SAP Concur. If the browser is not
compliant, users may not be able to sign in to SAP Concur.</p>

<p>In general, the use of less-secure TLS connections can lead to exposed data,
resulting in compromised sessions across any TLS channel of communication (for
example, SAP Concur services). For this reason, SAP Concur is alerting the client now to ensure they may anticipate this change and begin assessment in order to comply with this change at their companies.</p>

<h5 id="affected-devices">AFFECTED DEVICES</h5>

<p>In general, browsers using TLS to establish inbound / outbound communication
channels with SAP Concur services are affected, for example connections across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users attempting to log in to SAP Concur solutions</li>
  <li>APIs</li>
  <li>Bulk upload via SFTP</li>
  <li>Connectors</li>
  <li>FTP / PGP</li>
  <li>SAP Integrations</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability of a browser to upgrade to TLS v1.2 will depend on the
companyâ€™s support for the specific browser, for example Microsoft (Edge), Google
(Chrome), and others.</p>

<h5 id="informational-banner-to-display">INFORMATIONAL BANNER TO DISPLAY</h5>

<p>A banner will display when a user attempts to log in using a browser that does not
support TLS v1.2 and later and thus cannot negotiate a connection. The intent is to
alert the user to this upcoming change using an informational-only message.</p>

<h4 id="configuration--feature-activation">Configuration / Feature Activation</h4>

<p>Transitioning to support for TLS v1.2 and later may simply require updating security settings of your browser. In most instances, the company already has the support in place and need only identify non-compliant browsers and upgrade these userâ€™s browsers to newer versions.</p>

<p>Please check with the department in your company that is responsible for browser
compliance and ensure they are aware of this upcoming change.</p>
