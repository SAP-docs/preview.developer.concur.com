# This will add an "_" to all the fresh .md files in v3-0


# All markdown files in the 'includes' folder in Slate portion of the Dev Center repo


#Note for testing on your local machine, you may uncomment either of the below paths, either will work.
#They've been changed for use in CircleCI to specify the specific path as listed in the repository, rather than your machine
#So once you uncomment either path, kindly adjust the portion after the r" to wherever v3-0 is on your machine
# Once done, simply comment out the 'v3_0 = Path(r"./src/api-explorer/v3-0")' path and then it will run on your machine

#These are the 2 paths you may edit for testing on your machine:

#os.chdir(r"C:\Users\I860605\Desktop\Dev_Center_New\dev_concur\src\api-explorer\v3-0")
#v3_0 = Path(r"C:\Users\I860605\Desktop\Dev_Center_New\dev_concur\src\api-explorer\v3-0")

v3_0 = Path(r"./src/api-explorer/v3-0")

#Add "_" to the beginning of every markdown file that does not have it
for markdown in v3_0.listdir():
    #os.path.join(v3_0, markdown)
    #print(markdown)
    if "_" not in markdown:
        new_name = "_" + markdown
