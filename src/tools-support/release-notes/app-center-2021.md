Connecting Virtuo for Business with Concur Expense means that every time you finish a rental that needs to be expensed, the rental information will automatically appear in your Concur Expense account with an attached e-receipt, enabling you to manage your expenses easily and efficiently.

Virtuo for Business is a platform through which employees can rent cleaned and sanitised cars through a human-less process, 24/7, from airports, train stations, and city centers. Virtuo for Business is here to ensure your safety and comfort when travelling as well as offering you lower prices.

If you have not yet created your Virtuo profile, you will need to ask your travel manager to send you an invitation in order for the Virtuo connection with Concur Expense to work.

Virtuo works with Expense for Concur Standard and Expense for Concur Professional. It is now available in the SAP Concur App Center under User Connections at [https://www.concur.com/app-center](https://www.concur.com/app-center). For more information about the Mobicity integration, visit [https://www.govirtuo.com/fr/register](https://www.govirtuo.com/fr/register).
