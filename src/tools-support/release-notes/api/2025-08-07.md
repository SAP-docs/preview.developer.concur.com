# API Release Notes, August 2025

## New This Month

### Now Available: POST Operation Change in Attendee v4

The Attendee v4 API will have the POST behavior changed. During a POST operation, even if a single attendee matches the duplicate criteria, a duplicate error will be thrown. 

## Ongoing

### Preview: Public Certificate Root Change

To maintain compliance with evolving security standards and ensure uninterrupted compatibility with Mozilla-based browsers, we are transitioning our digital certificates to the updated DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 authorities:

* DigiCert Global Root G2 – for RSA-based certificates

* DigiCert Global Root G3 – for ECDSA-based certificates

This proactive update follows DigiCert’s announcement regarding Mozilla’s planned deprecation of the DigiCert Global Root CA.

Adopting the new root certificates is critical to avoid potential trust errors or connection issues when accessing our services via Mozilla browsers.

Target Implementation Dates:

Certificate|Implementation Date
---|---
*.concurcdc.cn|Oct 2, 2025
*.api.concurcdc.cn|Oct 9, 2025
*.concursolutions.com|Oct 23, 2025
*.api.concursolutions.com|Nov 6, 2025

Clients who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate will automatically be updated when it becomes available. 

#### RECOMMENDATION – Please Read Carefully

**Certificate pinning is not recommended.**

While it may add a layer of control, pinning certificates introduces risks. Certificates used by SAP Concur are renewed on a regular basis. Pinned certificates are not updated automatically and may cause service disruptions if not updated before implementation date.

#### FOR SAP ICS Customers

Please refer to section 2 “**Which SSL certificates do I need to have installed**” of [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977) for detailed instructions.

#### ACTION REQUIRED

If your systems **pin** the root or intermediate certificate, you must update your trust store to include the following certificates:

* Intermediate: [DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalG2TLSRSASHA2562020CA1-1.crt.pem?_gl=1*i7c9wi*_gcl_au*MTI2NjY3MzYyMC4xNzMyNTAwNTAw)

> Note: Most modern systems now prefer **ECDSA** for connections, while **RSA** is still used primarily by legacy systems. To ensure full compatibility, please ensure that your systems trust both **ECDSA and RSA certificates**.

**CERTIFICATE CHAIN LINKS**: (consist of end-entity, Intermediate, and Root certificates respectively). If your system is pinning the end-entity certificate, see the links below.
