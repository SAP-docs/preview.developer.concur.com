### Preview: SSL Certificate Renewal for *.concursolutions.com and *api.concursolutions.com

**Updated with links to new certificates.**

Starting in October 2025, DigiCert Global Root CA will be replaced by DigiCert Global Root G2. To ensure clients have adequate time to prepare for this Root certificate change, SAP Concur plans to renew the certificates for *.concursolutions.com and *api.concursolutions.com in March 2025.

>**Note**: The intermediate certificate and Root certificate for *.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com will not change in March 2025. Only the end-entity certificate (leaf certificate) will be updated.

**Availability Target Details**: The intermediate certificate and Root certificate for *.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com will not change in March 2025.

SAP Concur plans to issue new certificates as follows:

* 6PM PST on March 21, 2025 (*.concursolutions.com)
* 6PM PST March 27, 2025 (*.api.concursolutions.com)

The current certificates will expire as follows:

* 23:59 GMT on May 13, 2025 (*.concursolutions.com)
* 23:59 GMT on August 2, 2025 (*.api.concursolutions.com)

Clients who have not pinned the expiring certificate do not need to take any action as their expiring certificate will be renewed automatically. **Most clients do not pin the certificate.**

>**Note**: SAP ICS customers who follow the certificate handling processes described in the following note do not need to take any action:[2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977).

**User Experience**

Clients who have pinned an expiring certificate must update to the new certificate before the new certificate is issued at 6PM PST on March 20, 2025 (*.concursolutions.com) or at 6PM PST on March 27, 2025 (*.api.concursolutions.com).

Clients who have pinned the certificate and who do not update it with the new certificate before it is renewed, will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services.

**Configuration / Feature Activation**

>**IMPORTANT!** Certificate pinning is not recommended, and you do so at your own risk. To support security for SAP Concur solutions, security certificates are renewed regularly. Pinned certificates are not renewed automatically and, if a pinned certificate is not renewed before it expires, the pinned certificate can cause a disruption of service.

To avoid disruption of service, clients who pin their security certificates must pin both the RSA and ECDSA certificates. Clients may obtain the new certificates from the following web pages:

*.concursolutions.com
