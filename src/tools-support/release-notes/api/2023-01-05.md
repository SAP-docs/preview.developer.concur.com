# API Release Notes, January 2023

## New This Month

### Move from the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 to the Event Subscription Service (ESS)

With the decommission of the Concur Request v1 API on May 31st, 2023, calling the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 will no longer be possible. Please us the Event
Subscription Services (ESS) to subscribe to the [Request events](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/ess/v4.event-subscription.html).

### Planned Change: New Client SSL Certificate for ESS webhook.api.concursolutions.com

In an effort to ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, ESS will be issuing a new webhook.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificate.

Any customer who has pinned this expiring certificate will need to update to the new certificate prior to the expiration date. If the pinned certificate is not updated prior, your organization and users will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services. Customers who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate is updated automatically. Most customers do not pin the certificate.

NOTE: As an enhancement to our Security and Compliance program, this certificate will be updated on an annual basis.

## Ongoing

### Migration of Test Entities & Production Sandbox Environment

Some SAP Concur users use Production Sandbox Environment (PSE) entities to set up, test, and train on new configurations prior to deploying them to their live production entity. We plan to migrate PSEs as part of our move to Amazon Web Services (AWS). For more information, please see the **Test Entities: Production Sandbox Environment** release note in the August [Shared Release Notes](http://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/RN_shared_planned/_client_shared_RN_all.htm).

### SAP ICS Connector Production Sandbox Environment Migration Change Required

By early December 2022, we will be completing the migration of implementation environments to AWS. After migration, all users who are currently using:

* The SAP ICS Connector in their Production Sandbox Environment
* Legacy authentication (user and password)

will encounter an error in the Production Sandbox Environment. This will not impact your production environment and will not affect SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition customers.

In order to avoid disruption, authentication will need to be updated post-migration. Users can do this by updating their login ID to contain the .uat domain. For more information on how to update your login ID, please see the following [knowledge base article](https://sapconcur.my.salesforce.com/kA07V000000TmxK?lang=en_US).

### IP Address Range for Callouts

Beginning in August and continuing through the end of 2022, servers that support SAP Concur callouts in the US & EMEA datacenters will be upgraded. For more information on this release note, please see the August [Shared Release Notes](http://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/RN_shared_planned/_client_shared_RN_all.htm).
