# API Release Notes, May 2024

## New This Month

### Planned Change: Travel Allowance v4 API

The Travel Allowance v4 API will allow you to extract travel allowance information from the SAP Concur platform. The API provides the possibility to read travel allowance itinerary data, calculation results, and configuration settings.
 
The API can be used by customers and partners to build custom solutions to enhance their business processes wherever travel allowance data is needed. This could be reports, forms, special audit requirements, passing travel allowance data to time management systems for further processing and many more.

### Now Available: Hotel Service Change Notification API

The Hotel Service Change Notification API allows Custom Hotel Source (CHS) vendors to provide the SAP Concur platform with details of offline cancellations and changes they make to bookings created in the SAP Concur Online Booking tool (Travel Evolution). The API will allow CHS vendors to provide updates in real time so that travelers have the most up to date information about their booking.

As part of this release we have created a new shared schema page for Hotel Service v4 and this API.

### Planned Change: Deep Links now available for Air, Car, Hotel, and Rail

In late June, Concur Travel will add support for deep link URLs to Car, Hotel, and Rail Search Results. By providing URL parameters, customers and partners will be able to create a deep link that users can follow and land on Concur search results page bypassing the homepage.

 This feature enables clients and partners to incorporate Concur Travel into the journey maps they design for their end users. Developers can leverage the deep link to allow the user to skip the Concur home page and the search widget, making the booking process a more seamless part of larger end-to-end processes. 

### Planned Change: PGP Key for File Transfers to be Replaced

Files transferred to SAP Concur solutions must be encrypted with the SAP Concur public PGP key. 

* A new PGP key, key ID 8C51C89E, will be available in the client’s root folder beginning on or before May 24, 2024. The file name will be concursolutions.asc.
* The current key, key ID 9AFF10B5, will expire on September 4, 2024, and should no longer be used.
  
> More information about migrating from the legacy key (key ID D4D727C0) to the new key (key ID 8C51C89E), will be provided in the June 2024 release notes.

The expiration date of the current key (key ID 9AFF10B5) cannot be changed. To ensure that file uploads continue to be processed after the key expires on September 4, 2024, clients must migrate to the new PGP key (key ID 8C51C89E) before the expiration date. 

If you are unable to migrate to the new key (key ID 8C51C89E) before September 4, 2024, you can manually upload files using the Import / Extract Monitor feature.

> For more information about the Import / Extract Monitor feature, refer to the [Shared: Import/Extract Monitor User Guide](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/_Current/UG_Shr/Shr_UG_IE_Monitor.pdf).

**Admin Experience**

When it becomes available, an administrator with the required file transfer credentials can log into the file transfer site to retrieve the public PGP key, concursolutions.asc, from the root directory. 

**Configuration**

When it becomes available, your internal file transfer administrator can add the new key to their PGP keyring and start using it to encrypt files being transferred to SAP Concur. If you require assistance, please contact SAP Concur support.

> For more information, refer to the [Shared: File Transfer for Customers and Vendors User Guide](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/ConcurPremier/UG_Shr/Shr_UG_FileTransfer.pdf). 

### Planned Change: Retention Period for Credit Card Data Files

For compliance reasons, SAP Concur will be implementing a process wherein card data files received from external sources (Issuing banks, Card associations) will be deleted from systems after 90 days. In most cases, this should not be a concern as the normal practice is to automatically import and load the data contained in these files within 24 hours of receipt. In the case that the raw data is required following the 90 day window, clients can work with their issuing bank to have these files re-sent.

## Ongoing

**Cipher Security Policy Change for Clients and Vendors**
