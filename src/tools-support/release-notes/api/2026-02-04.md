### Preview: API Deprecation Headers

For APIs in deprecation, responses may include an `x-api-warn` header that identifies the deprecated endpoint and its recommended replacement. A sunset header will specify the planned decommission date and include a link to additional deprecation details, in compliance with SAP API policies. This will be applied to both API and UI gateways. For example:

* x-api-warn: '/api/v3.1/travelrequest/' is deprecated; use '/travelrequest/v4/'. See 'https://developer.concur.com/tools-support/release-notes/api/archive/2023-01-05.html' for details.

* sunset: Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT

### Preview: Groundspan Trip Extras v4

The Trip Extras v4 API will offer travelers ground transportation booking options through a redirect to Groundspan.This feature will replace the legacy Groundspan Direct Connect. This redirect will require the consumption of the following APIs: Event Subscription Service v4, Concur Travel Booking Events, Identity Change Event,Identity v4, Travel Extension v4, Travel Profile v2, Receipts v4, Maestro v4, Trip Extras v4.

## Ongoing

### Preview: Removal of concur.profile and concur.app Fields from Access Tokens(JWTs)

Two fields will be removed from Access Tokens (JWTs) and ID Tokens: `concur.profile` and `concur.app`. These fields currently contain fully formed URLs pointing to Profile v1 resources, for example:
- https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/principals/<principal id>
- https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/apps/<principal id>

These fields are being removed because the referenced URLs are no longer valid following the transition from Profile V1 to Profile v4. Also, these URLs were provided for convenience only and can be constructed using other information available in the JWT.

**Target Dates**
- Removal from Integration environments — week of March 23
- Removal from Production environments — week of April 6

**Required Action**
If your integration consumes either the `concur.profile` or `concur.app` fields from a JWT, update your implementation to remove this dependency by forming the necessary URL directly in your code.
