ERP and HR systems to automate budget configuration and maintenance as well as
importing external transactions not captured via SAP Concur through budget
adjustments.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

The Budget v4 API will be available to SAP Concur clients who have purchased Web
Services, or partners who have contracted with SAP Concur.

## <a name="quick-expense-v4"></a>Quick Expense v4 API Available

SAP Concur is releasing the [Quick Expense v4](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/quick-expense/v4.quick-expense.html) API for payment partner use.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

This new version of the Quick Expense API supports the latest SAP Concur API authentication method, and provides several enhancements to the POST functionality.

## <a name="quick-expense-v3-deprecation"></a>Quick Expense v3 API Deprecation

SAP Concur is deprecating the Quick Expense v3 API due to security vulnerabilities identified. This API is being replaced by Quick Expense v4. Quick Expense v3 will be decommissioned in a future release. Please migrate to the Quick Expense v4 API.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The Quick Expense v3 API only supports the previous authentication method, and it provides access to some fields that are not necessary to expose. These issues are resolved with the new Quick Expense v4 API.
