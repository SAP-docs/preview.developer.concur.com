# API Release Notes, December 2021

## New This Month

### Request v4 API - New Link to List Item Endpoint

We have introduced a new link to the List Item endpoint for Request custom fields related to a List. The availability of List Item API has enabled Request consumers to have a better interaction with custom fields related to a List.

To enable a better interaction between APIs, a new link has been provided within the Request `customField` schema to redirect to the corresponding List Item endpoint of the List API.

### Request v4 API – Agency Proposal Endpoint GA

Effective mid-December 2021, we will release an additional Request v4 API endpoint that will offer the ability for travel agencies to interact with Concur Request to submit travel itineraries directly into a request, via the agency proposal feature.

The support of the agency proposal feature, available on the Request NextGen UI, will provide a better experience, simpler connectivity, and deeper integration between travel agencies and Concur Request, as well as a better user experience in their interaction with their travel agencies.

This endpoint will provide added value to the existing Request v4 API, which already offers the ability for a user to interact with Concur Request to perform the following:

*	Get the list of existing Requests.
*	Get the detailed information of existing Requests.
*	Create, read, update, or delete an existing Request.
*	Move an existing Request through the approval flow.
*	Get the list of Expected Expenses (including trip segments) in a Request.
*	Create, read, update, or delete an expected expense (including trip segments) for a Request.
*	Get the list of Request policies assigned to a given user.
*	Get information of a travel agency office.

This additional endpoint will provide better capabilities for travel agencies who want to benefit from the Concur Request agency proposal feature with a direct consumption of the Request v4 API.

Depending on your travel agency, this feature may not be available for your company. Please coordinate with your travel agency to confirm their development completion of the required Request v4 API endpoints to benefit from this feature.
Additional information, please see the Request v4 API documentation.

## Ongoing

### OAuth 2.0 Migration

We will be converting from the legacy authentication (deprecated 2017) method to the new OAuth 2.0 authentication method. This effort will be taking place starting in the third quarter of 2021 and will conclude by the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Any existing partners, Client Web Service (CWS) clients, and clients with a Hosted Customer Connector using the legacy authentication (deprecated 2017) will need to be converted to the new OAuth 2.0 authentication. If you are a partner or a client using the legacy authentication (deprecated 2017) method, we will be reaching out and will provide communication on how to convert to the new OAuth 2.0 authentication. Clients with a Hosted Custom Connector will be handled by the SAP Concur Development team.

For more information, please refer to [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html).

With the ongoing effort of the authentication conversion project, we will be placing the Register Partner Application UI into a read-only state. Existing customers who still access or use this UI would now only be able to view their legacy authentication applications. Clients will be unable to create net-new or modify their existing legacy authentication applications.

With the launch of the Company Request Token Self-Service Tool and the Self-Service Tool for Application Management in July 2021, Clients should begin utilizing these tools and UI to create OAuth 2.0 applications. If you feel that your company has a proper business case to create a net-new legacy authentication application, please submit an SAP Concur Support case. The support case will be reviewed and either approved or denied. We will only allowing exceptions for the creation of net new legacy authentication applications until September 20th, 2021.

### Application Connector Username and Password Length Requirements Updated

Changes are being made to the length of usernames and passwords associated with application connectors. For more information please see the [Expense release notes](http://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/ConcurPremier/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesCPS_CCC.htm).

### Updated Naming Convention for Sub-URLs

Changes are being made to the naming conventions of sub-urls. For more information please see the [Expense release notes](http://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/ConcurPremier/ReleaseNotes/ExpRN_2021/ExpStdRN21_06_Cli_F.pdf).
